        <h3>Preface</h3>
        <pre>
This project is designed to automate TI checklist analysis:
<a href="https://adc.luxoft.com/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=DBPROD&title=07.+TI">TI checklist</a>
        </pre>

<h3>Usage hints</h3>
    <pre>
Use the following PONs for testing (with representative results)

Status   Name    Iteration
Actual   PON943  1
Previous PON928  1
<a href="http://172.30.136.166:8080/TIcheck/analyse?pon_name=PON943&pon_iteration=1&use_query_like=on&regression_check=on&prev_pon_name=PON928&prev_pon_iteration=1&use_query_like_for_prev=on&checklists=TIwithNoNDS&limit=100">PON943/1 to PON928/1</a>
Note: also reverse order may be used for demonstration purpose
<a href="http://172.30.136.166:8080/TIcheck/analyse?pon_name=PON928&pon_iteration=1&use_query_like=on&regression_check=on&prev_pon_name=PON943&prev_pon_iteration=1&use_query_like_for_prev=on&checklists=TIwithNoNDS&limit=100">PON928/1 to PON943/1</a>


Actual   PONB6A  1
Previous PONB2F  1
<a href="http://172.30.136.166:8080/TIcheck/analyse?pon_name=PONB6A&pon_iteration=1&use_query_like=on&regression_check=on&prev_pon_name=PONB2F&prev_pon_iteration=1&use_query_like_for_prev=on&checklists=TIwithNoNDS&limit=100">PONB6A/1 to PONB2F/1</a>

Actual   PONA    1
<a href="http://172.30.136.166:8080/TIcheck/analyse?pon_name=PONA&pon_iteration=1&use_query_like=on&prev_pon_name=PONB2F&prev_pon_iteration=1&use_query_like_for_prev=on&checklists=TIwithNoNDS&limit=100">PONA/1</a>

For SPIDER typical names are like PONA30_E7 and iteration is stored in separate column.
For BIRT  typical names are like PONA30_E7_BMD_MID_R1 (iteration is included in name).
If to use partial names better to use Use query LIKE %...% option.
In case you need exact result - uncheck Use query LIKE %...% option but be aware that
typically only one service will give the proper results!

For SPIDER errors are shown only in case that NOK record has been found for the requested error!
For BIRT errors are shown in the following way:
If for the FACT-test at least one result is NOK or SKIPPED - all BIRT records will be shown;
NOK are shown in red, SKIPPED are shown in blue.
If for the FACT-test all results are equal (not matter OK or another), name of PON will be aggregated
        and [Aggregated] will be added to the pon name (+ shown in blue and tooltip is visible with
        all pon names that were included).
In the Query column the actual query is shown (in tooltip).
In the Regression column result of regression check is shown in the following way:
        If actual PON is OK - regression is "Not analysed";
        If result for previous PON is the same as for actual - regression is "No";
        If result is not found:
            for SPIDER - regression is "Yes" - see the name of previous PON the tooltip;
            for BIRT - regression is "Not found" - see the name of previous PON the tooltip;
        If result is OK for BIRT - regression is "Yes" - see the name of previous PON the tooltip.

Before querying the BIRT DBs check is accomplished:
        1) if PON is detected in 2010 only, request is sent only to 2010
        2) if PON is detected in 2020 only, request is sent only to 2020
        3) if PON is detected in both DBs, requests are being sent to both DBs
           Note: suffix (2010) or (2020) is added to the test name for valid results.
        4) is PON is not detected at all - "Not found" is shown in the result column.

If limit value is less then total count of records, extracted from the DBs,
        then error log will be stored and displayed under the main form (total quantity of values will be shown).
        Note: please choose the greater value for the Limit.

If for some PON FACT tests were run for several times, then in the "Checked" column
        the following values will be shown in tooltip:
        Exit code (if NULL it meant that FACT test has been finished correctly!)
        Analyzed Flag
        Start time
        End time
        Failure description

        <b><font color="red">
        Important note: if PON has several iterations and, in worse case
        for some URs different iterations/revisions are used,
        <u>user should search only by UR name and specific iteration</u>!!!
        </font>

<h3>NDS DB check</h3>
    <pre>
    NDS part of checklist is in development!


 ndsSteps.add("tmcLocationTableIdTable");
 0MXXXX.NDS //One file must be processed!!!!
 NHXXXX.NDS //Many files must be processed!!!!

 ndsSteps.add("TI version tmcLocationTableIdTable");
 Find out what versions are current!!!

 DONE
 Task https://jira.harman.com/jira/browse/NAV2010ANA-23009 !!!!!
 Is incorporated to anaconda.nds.ti.TmcLocationExporterTest.tmcNameTableTest

 WAY OF PROCESSING IS NOT DEFINED - VISUAL TASK TO BE DEVELOPED !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 Filled Local_tmc_location on Route links
 TI Browser - TI icons and messages are present for TMC and TPEG_TEC
    </pre>


    <h3>TODO plans:</h3>
    <pre>

        1) Test DBs processing - location in SPIDER is DBPROD_test!
<font color="red">2) Solve the issue with the multiple iterations (FAST select functionality)</font>
        3) automatic deploy with Docker and Jenkins.
        4) automatic tests run before maven package.
        5) log-files to file redirect - monitor via WEB-interface.
        6) make AJAX service for PON name detection and result displaying.
        7) make RESTful API for other apps.
        8) DoS protection - users activity control.
        9) configs reload after requesting (is in development - view to add).
