        <h3>Preface</h3>
        <pre>
This project is designed to automate TI checklist analysis:
<a href="https://adc.luxoft.com/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=DBPROD&title=07.+TI">TI checklist</a>
        </pre>

<h3>Usage hints</h3>
    <pre>
Use the following PONs for testing (with representative results)

Status   Name    Iteration
Actual   PON943  1
Previous PON928  1
<a href="http://172.30.136.166:8080/TIcheck/analyse?pon_name=PON943&pon_iteration=1&use_query_like=on&regression_check=on&prev_pon_name=PON928&prev_pon_iteration=1&use_query_like_for_prev=on&checklists=TIwithNoNDS&limit=100">PON943/1 to PON928/1</a>

Actual   PONB6A  1
Previous PONB2F  1
<a href="http://172.30.136.166:8080/TIcheck/analyse?pon_name=PONB6A&pon_iteration=1&use_query_like=on&regression_check=on&prev_pon_name=PONB2F&prev_pon_iteration=1&use_query_like_for_prev=on&checklists=TIwithNoNDS&limit=100">PONB6A/1 to PONB2F/1</a>

Actual   PONA    1
<a href="http://172.30.136.166:8080/TIcheck/analyse?pon_name=PONA&pon_iteration=1&use_query_like=on&prev_pon_name=PONB2F&prev_pon_iteration=1&use_query_like_for_prev=on&checklists=TIwithNoNDS&limit=100">PONA/1</a>

For SPIDER typical names are like PONA30_E7 and iteration is stored in separate column.
For BIRT  typical names are like PONA30_E7_BMD_MID_R1 (iteration is included in name).
If to use partial names better to use Use query LIKE %...% option.
In case you need exact result - uncheck Use query LIKE %...% option but be aware that
typically only one service will give the proper results!

For SPIDER errors are shown only in case that NOK record has been found for the requested error!
For BIRT errors are shown in the following way:
If for the FACT-test at least one result is NOK or SKIPPED - all BIRT records will be shown;
NOK are shown in red, SKIPPED are shown in blue.
If for the FACT-test all results are equal (not matter OK or another), name of PON will be aggregated
        and [Aggregated] will be added to the pon name (+ shown in blue and tooltip is visible with
        all pon names that were included).
In the Query column the actual query is shown (in tooltip).
In the Regression column result of regression check is shown in the following way:
        If actual PON is OK - regression is "Not analysed";
        If result for previous PON is the same as for actual - regression is "No";
        If result is not found:
            for SPIDER - regression is "Yes" - see the name of previous PON the tooltip;
            for BIRT - regression is "Not found" - see the name of previous PON the tooltip;
        If result is OK for BIRT - regression is "Yes" - see the name of previous PON the tooltip.

        <b><font color="red">
        Important note: if PON has several iterations and, in worse case
        for some URs different iterations/revisions are used,
        <u>user should search only by UR name and specific iteration</u>!!!

<h3>NDS DB check</h3>
    <pre>
    NDS part of checklist is in development!


 ndsSteps.add("tmcLocationTableIdTable");
 0MXXXX.NDS //One file must be processed!!!!
 NHXXXX.NDS //Many files must be processed!!!!

 ndsSteps.add("TI version tmcLocationTableIdTable");
 Find out what versions are current!!!

 DONE
 Task https://jira.harman.com/jira/browse/NAV2010ANA-23009 !!!!!
 Is incorporated to anaconda.nds.ti.TmcLocationExporterTest.tmcNameTableTest

 WAY OF PROCESSING IS NOT DEFINED - VISUAL TASK TO BE DEVELOPED !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 Filled Local_tmc_location on Route links
 TI Browser - TI icons and messages are present for TMC and TPEG_TEC
    </pre>


    <h3>TODO plans:</h3>
    <pre>

        1) automatic deploy with Docker and Jenkins.
        2) automatic tests run before maven package.
        3) automatic refresh of configs after requesting is in development.
        4) make AJAX for PON name detection and result displaying
        5) make Api for other apps
        <font color="red">6) BIRT - clarify with exitcode parameter!!!</font>
        7) test DBs processing - location differs
